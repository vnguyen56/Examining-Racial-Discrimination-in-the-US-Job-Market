# Examining-Racial-Discrimination-in-the-US-Job-Market

In this analysis, we attempt to see if white-sounding names receive significantly more callbacks from potential employers than black-sounding names do. These are the questions we will answer:

  What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?
  What are the null and alternate hypotheses?
  Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value. Try using both the bootstrapping and the frequentist statistical approaches.
  Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.
  Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?
